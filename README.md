# Blackjack_AI
This project is an advanced Blackjack strategy assistant developed in Python. It utilizes Reinforcement Learning to train an AI agent from the ground up to master optimal Blackjack strategy, including complex actions and card counting. The application serves as an educational tool to simulate real-life casino scenarios, providing real-time, data-driven recommendations to maximize decision-making accuracy.

The core of the project is a Q-learning agent that discovers its strategy by playing millions of simulated games against a custom-built game engine. The final application features an interactive GUI where a user can input card values from a live game to receive immediate, mathematically sound advice from the trained AI.
